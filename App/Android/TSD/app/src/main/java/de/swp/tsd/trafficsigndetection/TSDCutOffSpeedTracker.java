 * This class defines an {@link TSDShutterCameraImageListener.FrameEventListener} which uses the

 * should still allow the device to properly detect the signs on the captured images. The background
 * to this is, that sign detection is extremely processing intensive and pushes even high-end
 * phones from two years ago to the limits. That is why this class tries to use the given
 * time which was taken to process single frames and further information to calculate an
 * approximated value describing the maximum speed the device can move and still should be fast
 * enough to capture and process enough frames to get every sign around there.
