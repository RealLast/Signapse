 * to not directly use the constructor but to use the builder factory like this:
 * ViewModelProviders.of(mActivity).get(TSDSignHistory.class)
 * Furthermore the {@link TSDSignCombination sign combinations} are stored inside
 * {@link MutableLiveData} what makes it possible to register as an listener to and to receive
 * signals whenever the collection is changed.
 * The history also contains a {@link TSDSpeedChecker} to track the currently allowed speed limit
 * using the history of recognized signs.
