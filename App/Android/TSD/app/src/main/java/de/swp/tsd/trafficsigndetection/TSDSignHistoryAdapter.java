/**
 * This class is an adapter to display all but the latest sign combinations in a given sign
 * history to a {@link RecyclerView}. For displaying the single sign combination a
 * {@link TSDSignCombinationViewHolder} is used. The sign itself are drawn transparent to be
 * easily distinguished from the main sign. No speed or warning information are displayed in the
 * history.
 * The display of the history is implemented using a {@link RecyclerView} because this type of
 * list view efficiently reuses some views to display the visible part of the list instead of
 * either creating new ones the whole time when the user is scrolling or instead of holding one
 * view for every sign in the collection, which would also be inefficient, since only a portion of
 * them is visible.

     * This constructor creates a new instance of {@link TSDSignHistoryAdapter} which starts to

     * {@link TSDSignHistoryAdapter#mSignCombis list} and updated the {@link RecyclerView} with
     * the new elements, too. As long as the first card is at least partially visible, the view
     * will automatically scroll to the start when a new card is inserted at the front. Otherwise
     * the user would continue to see the old cards when not scrolling to the start of the list
