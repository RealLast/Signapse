/**
 * This multithreading proof class analyses given signs and classifies given speeds according to the
 * signs in ok or too fast. This is done by checking the incoming signs for opened or ended special
 * speed zones like described in {@link TSDSign}. When no special zone is open and not speed
 * limit is set, then a base speed limit is used. When a special speed zone is started and no
 * further speed limit is recognized, then the speed limit given by the zone is used. When inside
 * the zone a further speed limit occurs, then this speed limit will get used.
 * If in one combination there are multiple speed limits, then for safety reasons the lowest limit
 * is taken.
 * The multithreading proof is accomplished by using a semaphore to achieve exclusive access for one
 * method call from one thread to the internal variables at a given time.
