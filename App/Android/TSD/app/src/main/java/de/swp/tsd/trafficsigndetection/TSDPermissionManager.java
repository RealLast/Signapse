/**
 * This class is only for static use. Its functions can be used for requesting app permissions
 * on runtime and reacting on the users result. To use this class, a request handler method needs
 * to be implemented in the request receiving activity like for example here:
 * {@link MainActivity#onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[])}.
 * Then permissions can be requested by calling
 * {@link TSDPermissionManager#getPermissions(Activity, OnRequestPermissionResultListener, long)}.
 * The delivered listener will get notified, when the users decision is known. This could be
 * even before asking the user for any permission if he has permitted them already or when he
 * accepted all or declined at least one of them. The signaled result will be accordingly. When the
 * user declined at least one of the permissions, a {@link Snackbar} will be displayed to him giving
 * him information about the effects of the decline and a button to ask for the permissions again.
