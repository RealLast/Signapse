/**
 * This class is the base for every specialized camera used in this application. Its task is to
 * manage the opening and closing of the given {@link CameraDevice} taking the lifecycle of the
 * parent into consideration closing and reopening the camera when the parent gets paused and
 * resumed. Using the {@link OnCameraEventListener} the behaviour of the camera can be defined.
 * The lifecycle handling is done by the {@link TSDLifecycleObserver} base class. The camera is run
 * inside a background thread which gets started and stopped together with the camera itself.
 * Startup and Stopping are locked to each other by a semaphore avoiding that the camera could be
 * stopped before it was even completely started. Please mind, that this class does not handle
 * the runtime camera permission. This needs to be done outside the class. Otherwise the camera
 * initialization will fail.
 * To define a new camera behaviour based on this class you need the create an
 * {@link OnCameraEventListener}. This listener gets signaled on every important camera event
 * and should be used for defining the behavior and the used camera target surfaces.
 * @see OnCameraEventListener
